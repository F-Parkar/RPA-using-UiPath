# Project Description
- Users are required to engage in testing processes, including user acceptance testing (UAT) to validate expected outputs. 
  Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is suggested for automating repetitive tasks in scenarios like web application testing, boosting efficiency.
  
#Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
- Technology that uses software robots or bots to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks and processes within an organization. 
  There are many reasons why RPA is widely adopted and its advantages include:
- Efficiency and Productivity:
  RPA can perform tasks 24/7 without breaks, leading to increased productivity and reduced processing times. 
  This results in faster and more efficient operations.
- Cost Savings:
  By automating repetitive tasks, RPA can significantly reduce labor costs, as organizations can redirect human resources 
  to more strategic and value-added activities.
- Accuracy:
  RPA bots are highly accurate and do not make errors due to fatigue, boredom, or distractions. 
  This reduces the risk of data entry and processing errors.
